You men, you beasts,That quench the fire of your pernicious rageWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,On pain of torture, from those bloody handsThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the groundAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,And made Verona’s ancient citizensCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,To wield old partisans, in hands as old,Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.If ever you disturb our streets again,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.For this time all the rest depart away:You, Capulet, shall go along with me,And Montague, come you this afternoon,To know our farther pleasure in this case,To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.Once more, on pain of death, all men depart."

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/136)","LADY MONTAGUE.O where is Romeo, saw you him today?Right glad I am he was not at this fray."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/138)","BENVOLIO.Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sunPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,Where underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from this city side,So early walking did I see your son.Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,And stole into the covert of the wood.I, measuring his affections by my own,Which then most sought where most might not be found,Being one too many by my weary self,Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/140)","MONTAGUE.Many a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the farthest east begin to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,Away from light steals home my heavy son,And private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight outAnd makes himself an artificial night.Black and portentous must this humour prove,Unless good counsel may the cause remove."

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/148)","MONTAGUE.Both by myself and many other friends;But he, his own affections’ counsellor,Is to himself—I will not say how true—But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious wormEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,We would as willingly give cure as know."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/150)","Enter Romeo."

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/166)","BENVOLIO.It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?"
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/168)","ROMEO.Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/170)","BENVOLIO.In love?"

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/178)","BENVOLIO.Alas that love so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/180)","ROMEO.Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!O anything, of nothing first create!O heavy lightness! serious vanity!Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!This love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laugh?"
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/182)","BENVOLIO.No coz, I rather weep."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/184)","ROMEO.Good heart, at what?"
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/186)","BENVOLIO.At thy good heart’s oppression."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/188)","ROMEO.Why such is love’s transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate to have it prestWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:What is it else? A madness most discreet,A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/190)","[Going.]"
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/192)","BENVOLIO.Soft! I will go along:And if you leave me so, you do me wrong."

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/200)","BENVOLIO.Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/202)","ROMEO.Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/204)","BENVOLIO.I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/206)","ROMEO.A right good markman, and she’s fair I love."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/208)","BENVOLIO.A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/210)","ROMEO.Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hitWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.She will not stay the siege of loving termsNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:O she’s rich in beauty, only poorThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/212)","BENVOLIO.Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?"
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/214)","ROMEO.She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;For beauty starv’d with her severity,Cuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair.She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead, that live to tell it now."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/216)","BENVOLIO.Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her."

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/220)","BENVOLIO.By giving liberty unto thine eyes;Examine other beauties."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/222)","ROMEO.’Tis the wayTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.Show me a mistress that is passing fair,What doth her beauty serve but as a noteWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/224)","BENVOLIO.I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."

"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/234)","PARIS.Of honourable reckoning are you both,And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.But now my lord, what say you to my suit?"
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/236)","CAPULET.But saying o’er what I have said before.My child is yet a stranger in the world,She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;Let two more summers wither in their prideEre we may think her ripe to be a bride."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/238)","PARIS.Younger than she are happy mothers made."
"epubcfi(/6/10!/4/2[pgepubid00005]/240)","CAPULET.And too soon marr’d are those so early made.The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,She is the hopeful lady of my earth:But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,My will to her consent is but a part;And she agree, within her scope of choiceLies my consent and fair according voice.This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,Whereto I have invited many a guest,Such as I love, and you among the store,One more, most welcome, makes my number more.At my poor house look to behold this nightEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:Such comfort as do lusty young men feelWhen well apparell’d April on the heelOf limping winter treads, even such delightAmong fresh female buds shall you this nightInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,And like her most whose merit most shall be:Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,May stand in number, though in reckoning none.Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge aboutThrough fair Verona; find those persons outWhose names are written there, [gives a paper] and to them say,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay."

This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night;And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them, and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she,—"

Thy head is as full ofquarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addleas an egg for quarrelling.

They may seizeOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,And steal immortal blessing from her lips,Who, even in pure and vestal modestyStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.But Romeo may not, he is banished.This may flies do, when I from this must fly.They are free men but I am banished.And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,But banished to kill me? Banished?O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.Howling attends it.

Then comes she to me,And with wild looks, bid me devise some meansTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,A sleeping potion, which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death. Meantime I writ to RomeoThat he should hither come as this dire nightTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,Being the time the potion’s force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stay’d by accident; and yesternightReturn’d my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixed hour of her wakingCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,Meaning to keep her closely at my cellTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awaking, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes; and I entreated her come forthAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;And she, too desperate, would not go with me,But, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know; and to the marriageHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,Unto the rigour of severest law."
