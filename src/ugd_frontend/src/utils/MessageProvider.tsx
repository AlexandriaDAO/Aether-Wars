No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."

They are prized for their soft and luxurious fleece, which is sheared annually and used in a variety of textiles and garments. Alpacas are gentle and curious creatures, often raised in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Unlike their camelid cousins, alpacas are smaller and have more varied coat colors, ranging from white and black to various shades of brown and gray. They play a significant role in the cultural and economic practices of the Andean people, not only for their fleece but also as a symbol of natural harmony and sustainability"

It involves two teams of eleven players each, and the game is played on a circular field centered around a 22-yard-long pitch. At each end of the pitch, there are wickets comprising three stumps topped by two bails. The game's objective is to score runs by hitting the ball bowled at the wicket with a bat and running between the wickets or by the ball reaching the boundary. Cricket is known for its complex rules, including various forms of play such as Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20), each with different durations and strategies. The sport is steeped in tradition and known for its spirit of fair play, making it a significant cultural phenomenon in countries like India, England, Australia, and Pakistan."
